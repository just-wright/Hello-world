# Hello-world
## Introduction to github.
> A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...
A determined padawan learner named **David Ngunjiri** took up programming as his discipline of choice. His lightsaber was *python*.
The first few projects he planned were:
1. The Phantom of Menace: An NLP application that acts as the Devil's advocate.
2. The Clone Army Attacketh: A game.
3. Tragedy of the Sith's Revenge: A therapy app that works like Ada.

In order to do so, however, he needed to acquire the skills necessary. Therefore, he begun with:
- A portfolio with Django.
- A personal diary with Django.
- A pencil sketch/cartoon generator.

`Verily, A New Hope.`
